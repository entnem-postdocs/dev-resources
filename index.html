<h1>This document is designed to be an evolving list of information about opportunities to improve or obtain skills required by post docs affiliated to the department. They encompass both professional and personal skills that might be of interest for career advancement, whether your goals are within academia, industry or government. Depending on your path, some experience outside of research experience into the so-called soft skills might be necessary. As such, look over the entire list and seek out those that might complement or enhance your current CV. The list is meant to be updated continuously, as new options arise and others close. If you know of any items that might be of interest to someone pursuing a post doc in the department, do not hesitate to share the information by sending it to Emiliano Cant√≥n (cantonojeda.p@ufl.edu). Likewise, if some item on the list has become obsolete, also please inform us in order to keep the list current and relevant.

Enjoy, and good luck!
